- Go backend, React front end


GO BACKEND
- could not get dependencies (dls from github) without using modules
    -> go mod init todo-backend
- now can get dependencies:
    - go get github.com/gorilla/mux
    - go get github.com/rs/cors
- now can do 'go run main.go' to run go server

- added to github (after creating repo in github)
    - git init
    - git add .
    - git commit -m "..."
    - git remote add origin https://github.com/infusca/toDoApp.git
    - git push -u origin master

- created new folder and moved files -> need to initialize new go module

- if issues can try the following
    - go build --> will check for syntax errors
    - go clean -modcache -> go build --> will clear and rebuild


REACT FRONTEND
- npx create-react-app todo-app-frontend (enter folder) (no caps allowed)
- cd into app -> src -> components (create folder) -> create toDo.js
- update App.js to include ToDo component
- npm start
